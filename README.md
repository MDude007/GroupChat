# GroupChat
Manage groups, users and have chat.

Currently there are 10 users with userIDs: user0, user1, ..., user9
And the password is: "password"

We can not proceed further without the above credentials.

Only those groups of which the user is part of will be visible.

By clicking on the particular group we can navigate to the Chat Page.

User can create new group by clicking on "+" in the Home Screen. He will be prompted to add "Group Name" and select the users who he wants to add to the group.

User can see the details of the group by clicking on the three dots icon. If he is the admin of that group he can edit the group details, add/remove othere users and delete the group.
